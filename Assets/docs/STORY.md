FADE IN:

Ext. space - timeless void

WE OPEN with Chaos, a primordial being of space dust and particles, spirals around in the vast emptiness of space, with thundering booms and flashing lights.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
(mythically, with gravitas)
Chaos ensued.


Chaos spins. We zoom in to the swirling, seeing Chaos at a closer angle.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
(Continuously dramatic)
Timeless, unbounded, unforgiving.


A third angle of Chaos.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
But then...


There is a cosmic boom. The force is so intense that causes particles to fly outward from Chaos’s center. We see dust and particles turn into rocks, which rapidly circle each other. From this debris, Gaia, the Earth, and Uranus, the sky, are born.

Ext. The cosmos - new light flickering

We first see A Star form rapidly, almost magically, as the debris circle and spiral around each other until The Sun is formed.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
... a star is born.


Ext. Space

We see Gaia, a primordial being that represents the Earth, beginning to form. Rock and debris circle each other, smashing into each other and start to form structure. The Creation slows, as Gaia is not yet fully formed. We see the Earth slowly spin in its unfinished Glory.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And soon...


CUT TO:

EXT. Earth - Close up, Day


We see Gaia, with peaks and valleys beginning to form. Unfinished bodies of water cover Her, along with trees, mountains, and other elemental creations. We see valleys, deserts, an ocean, and an island.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
...other creations follow.

The sun shines through Uranus - the sky - onto Gaia’s surface, warming Her and sprouting new life. Titans begin to grow from the soil, but are trapped.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
But The Sky was a merciless ruler. He detested the life that he created, fearing that they would ruin what could become.

Through Her surface, a Titan, Cronus, emerges from the soil, determined to free those that remain buried underneath.


NARRATOR (CONT’D)
But Time proved to be fearless.


We see Cronus facing the sky, arms up, with cosmic rays exerting from his hands, causing the sky to break. As the sky breaks, stars can be seen through the cracks.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
For a world was not perfect without life...


Other Titans begin to emerge from the soils, from the oceans, from the sands. 

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
...where death must follow.


As Uranus fights back by raining debris onto the Earth, some Titans fall back into the Earth.


NARRATOR (CONT’D)
So Time was inevitable, and the Sky was forced to let go of its hold on The Earth.


We see Cronus, a formidable Titan being, standing over Gaia.


NARRATOR (CONT'D)
For Cronus was Time. And He knew that power was delicate.

Ext. Mt. Othrys - night

We see Cronus's palace in the mountains of Othrys.

Int. Mt. Othrys - Cronus's palace

Rhea, a primordial being, births a child. She gives the child to Cronus, and he swallows it.


NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Worried that He too could be removed from His throne, Cronus devoured his offspring...


Cronus swallows three more children, one by one.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
...one by one, ensuring His reign would never be hindered.

We see Rhea facing away from Cronus as he devours another child, physically upset and distraught.


NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Rhea was heartbroken. She couldn't bear to see another child be eaten by Cronus.

EXT. Crete Valley - Day

A luscious valley on Earth's unfinished surface - with cliffs, trees, a large center lake, a rapid waterfall, and a cave.

INT. Crete Valley - Cave

Rhea, again pregnant, stands in a cave, with Amalthea, a Goat, with a pure, white fur coat and two female Nymphs, Ada and Adrasteia, with pure white gowns and gold headpieces. All three attend to Rhea with care.

We, then, see Rhea holding a male child.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
So she fled to the mountains of Crete Valley, where He was born in captivity, to be raised by Amalthea, a motherly Goat, with the help of two nymphs, Ada and Adrasteia, who would help care for Him.

INT. MT. OTHRYS - Cronus's Palace

Cronus swallows what he thinks to be a child, but is actually a child-sized rock, covered in a small cloth resembling a blanket.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Rhea wrapped a large stone in cloth and returned it to Cronus. Believing it to be another child, he swallows it whole.


INT. CRETE VALLEY - CAVE


We see Zeus held by one of the Nymphs, be fed milk from a small bowl.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
The child would be raised off of Amalthea's milk.

EXT. CRETE VALLEY - day

We see Zeus, older, standing in a small covered forest of trees in Crete Valley. He continues to grow over time.


NARRATOR (CONT'D)
He grows, shielded from Cronus's reign.


The camera slowly zooms in on Zeus's face.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
He is the one that will challenge Cronus's authority.

CUT TO:

EXT. Black screen

There is a rumbling thunder.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
He is Zeus.
